             My journey began as a visitor, and I later switched my status to a student visa. For a long time, I've
              been searching for a way to secure a green card for my family. Then, a friend of mine introduced me to
               the EB3 unskilled visa. After thorough research and checking all the criteria, I discovered that I am 
               eligible for this visa category.I couldn't afford the high fees charged by EB3 agencies, especially 
            since my college had shifted to online tuition due to COVID-19 ... "
             description=" leaving me unable to earn money by working on campus.To add to the challenge, my wife
              was pregnant with our third child, which put me in a tough situation. Luckily, I obtained my OPT and 
              secured employment with a U.S. employer where I took on extra shifts to save up money for the EB3 program. 
              In August 2020, my Labor Certification was filed, and after 8 months, it was approved. Subsequently, I-140 was
               filed, but the USCIS issued a request for evidence. To maintain my lawful status, I was forced to take an additional
                semester in college. During this time, I gathered all the necessary evidence to respond to the Request for Evidence
                 (RFE) and re-filed the I-140 form. Once the I-140 was approved, I promptly filed for my Employment Authorization
                  Document, advance parole, and my I-485, which is the green card application. I was incredibly surprised when,
                   in May 2022, I received a letter from USCIS with green cards for all my family members with NO immigration
                    interview. I relocated from Texas to South Carolina since I had to work in an unskilled position for 12 
                    months at my sponsor's gas station in SC. Once I fulfilled my obligation, I transitioned to a skilled 
                    position with another U.S. employer. It's still hard to believe that I've obtained my 10-year green card
                     and have the official right to work legally in the U.S. The EB3 unskilled route may not be the easiest
                      path to a green card, but if you're considering it and want our team's support with your case, please
                       don't hesitate to contact us.

             Christmas Eve. Before embarking on my EB3 journey, I had the experience of giving birth in the U.S., and I was incredibly
              impressed by the high level of medical services. This experience strengthened my determination to make the U.S. a part
               of my life. Since 2016 I started researching all U.S. immigration programs to find legal ways to immigrate.
             ..." description=" It took me 2 years to make a conclusion EB3 unskilled program suits me, despite I have master's
              degree in economics and 15+ years of professional job experience. I was concerned that my application might be rejected
               due to my overqualification and the fact that I had given birth in the U.S. To confirm my eligibility for the EB3 
               unskilled category, I checked with the USCIS. I eventually applied for the EB3 unskilled category. The process was
                lengthy, involving challenges at each step of the process. My Labor Certificate got randomly audited, my I-140 
                petition for the alien worker was denied, and there was a huge delay in scheduling the immigration interview due to
                 the transfer of my immigration case from my home country to the U.S. embassy in Poland,  and moreover my medical
                  exam required additional 6 weeks lab research. Despite all those challenges, I successfully passed the immigration
                   interview and received the immigration visa. Since crossing the U.S. border, I have been working at a local store 
                   as a grocery clerk.
